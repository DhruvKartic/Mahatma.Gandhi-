        <p>Sabarmati Ashram (also known as Gandhi Ashram) is located in the Sabarmati suburb of Ahmedabad, Gujarat, adjoining the Ashram Road, on the banks of the River Sabarmati, 4 miles (6.4 km) from the town hall. This was one of the many residences of Mahatma Gandhi who lived at Sabarmati, when he was not travelling across India or in prison. He lived here for a total of twelve years with his wife Kasturba Gandhi and followers, including Vinoba Bhave. The Bhagavad Gita was recited here daily as part of the Ashram schedule.</p>

The ashram employed some harijans in the common kitchen to break the caste barrier. Vinoba Bhave's Param Dham Ashram is located on the banks of the Dhaam river close by. Many decisions on important national matters and movements were taken at Sevagram. It became the central place for a number of institutions for the nation building activities devised by Gandhiji to suit the inherent strength of this country.</p>

        <p>In an event that would have dramatic repercussions for the people of India, Mohandas K. Gandhi, a young Indian lawyer working in South Africa, refuses to comply with racial segregation rules on a South African train and is forcibly ejected at Pietermaritzburg.

Born in India and educated in England, Gandhi traveled to South Africa in early 1893 to practice law under a one-year contract. Settling in Natal, he was subjected to racism and South African laws that restricted the rights of Indian laborers. Gandhi later recalled one such incident, in which he was removed from a first-class railway compartment and thrown off a train, as his moment of truth. From thereon, he decided to fight injustice and defend his rights as an Indian and a man.

   When his contract expired, he spontaneously decided to remain in South Africa and launch a campaign against legislation that would deprive Indians of the right to vote. He formed the Natal Indian Congress and drew international attention to the plight of Indians in South Africa. In 1906, the Transvaal government sought to further restrict the rights of Indians, and Gandhi organized his first campaign of satyagraha, or mass civil disobedience. After seven years of protest, he negotiated a compromise agreement with the South African government.

In 1914, Gandhi returned to India and lived a life of abstinence and spirituality on the periphery of Indian politics. He supported Britain in the First World War but in 1919 launched a new satyagraha in protest of Britain’s mandatory military draft of Indians. Hundreds of thousands answered his call to protest, and by 1920 he was leader of the Indian movement for independence. Always nonviolent, he asserted the unity of all people under one God and preached Christian and Muslim ethics along with his Hindu teachings. The British authorities jailed him several times, but his following was so great that he was always released.


After World War II, he was a leading figure in the negotiations that led to Indian independence in 1947. Although hailing the granting of Indian independence as the “noblest act of the British nation,” he was distressed by the religious partition of the former Mogul Empire into India and Pakistan. When violence broke out between Hindus and Muslims in India in 1947, he resorted to fasts and visits to the troubled areas in an effort to end India’s religious strife. On January 30, 1948, he was on one such prayer vigil in New Delhi when he was fatally shot by Nathuram Godse, a Hindu extremist who objected to Gandhi’s tolerance for the Muslims.</p>

        <p>1. Champaran Movement (1917): Gandhi’s active participation in the Freedom Struggle started when he led the Champaran rebellion in Bihar. The movement was an approach of civil disobedience to make Britishers agree to the demand of farmers, who were forcefully made to grow Indigo. He signed an agreement in which Britishers granted control and compensations to the farmers, canceled the hikes in revenue and collection. After the success of this movement, Gandhi earned the status of Mahatma.</p>
<br>
<p>
2. Kheda Movement (1918): In the next year after Champaran, 1918, Kheda, a village in Gujarat, was badly hit by floods. The local farmers appealed to the rulers to waive off the taxes. To help them, Gandhi started a signature campaign where peasants pledged non-payment of taxes. He also arranged a social boycott of the revenue officials.</p>
<br>
        <p>
3. Khilafat Movement (1919): Gandhi has a major influence on the Muslim population of India. It helped in uniting the country at the time of crisis, when Britishers tried their best to divide the nation on religious grounds. After World War 1, Muslims feared for the safety of their Caliph or religious leaders. Gandhi participated actively in the movement, and became a prominent spokesperson for the All India Muslim Conference.</p>
<br>
        <p>4. Non-cooperation Movement (1920): After all these years of his active participation, Gandhi realized that the British had been able to be in India only because of the co-operation they received from the Indians. To counter this, he started the non-cooperation movement. He convinced people that non-cooperation was the key to Independence. He also set the goal of Swaraj or self-governance.
        </p>            
<br>
        <p>
5. Salt (Dandi) March (1929): The famous Dandi Movement, also known as the Salt March, began when Gandhi started a Satyagraha campaign against the salt tax in March, 1930. He marched 388 kilometres from Ahmedabad to Dandi in Gujarat to make salt. He was joined by thousands of people.</p>
<br>
        <p>
6. Quit India Movement (1942): The final nail in the coffin for British Raj in India was the Quit India Movement, led by Gandhi in 1942. He firmly protested against the British rule and said that the Indians cannot be involved in World War II.</p>
